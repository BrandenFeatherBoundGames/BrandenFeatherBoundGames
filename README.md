'Sup Nerds,
  Good (Whatever time of day you are currently experiencing) My name is Branden and I'm the founder of FeatherBound Games Studio. We're a small team founded in a local trade school for a completely unrelated degree program. 

- Our early projects are intended to be low budget, small concept games that are more for us learning but still enjoyable for our supporters. If that includes you, hell yeah. If not, well thanks for visiting. We are starting out with GoDot but intend to branch out later to more powerful engines. 

- We're pretty big on transparency so feel free to message me with any questions you may be searching for answers for. My gmail is featherboundgames@gmail.com
